Once you have finished with a recipe you can delete this by simply clicking on a delete button on your recipe listing page.",""," 6. Searching for a recipe can be done 2 ways. There is a quick search option on the main recipe display page just underneath the navbar which can search for either a recipe name or cuisine. A more advanced search is also available by clicking the advanced search button where you can search by recipe name, cuisine, rating, servings and preparation time.","","","## Technologies Used","","","- [JQuery / Javascript](https://jquery.com)","    - The project uses **JQuery / Javascript** for initialization on materialise elements functionality to make the users have more of an experience using the website.
